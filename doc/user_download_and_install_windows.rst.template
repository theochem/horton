Download and installation on Windows 10 64-bit (v. 1607)
########################################################


Disclaimer
==========

HORTON has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 subsystem available on Windows 10 64-bit (after
Windows 10 Anniversary Update i.e. v.1607). The Ubuntu 14.04 subsystem is not available to
any Windows operating systems prior to the Windows 10 (v.1607) or 32-bit Windows systems.
Cygwin based installation is not supported (although possible in theory).


Enable Bash on Windows 10
=========================

Provided you are using the appropriate version of Windows 10 (64-bit, after Window 10
Anniversary Update), go to "Settings > Update & Security > For Developers" (or
alternatively search "Use Developer Features") and activate "Developer Mode". Then, go to
"Programs and Features" and click "Turn Windows Features On or Off". Check the box
"Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)". Restart Computer. Search "Bash" to open Ubuntu 14.04
subsystem terminal.


Download the code
=================

The latest stable source code release of HORTON can be downloaded here:

    https://github.com/theochem/horton/releases/download/2.0.1/horton-2.0.1.tar.gz

Choose a suitable directory, e.g. ``~/build``, download and unpack the archive

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/build
    cd ~/build
    curl -kLO https://github.com/theochem/horton/releases/download/2.0.1/horton-2.0.1.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf horton-2.0.1.tar.gz
    cd horton-2.0.1


Check Ubuntu Version (Just In Case)
===================================
On bash,

.. code-block:: bash

  lsb_release -a

It should be `14.04.4 LTS`, but other versions may be available.


Dependencies for building, installing and testing HORTON
========================================================

In order to compile and test HORTON, you need to install relatively recent
versions of the following programs/libraries:

${dependencies_rst}


Installing dependencies with a package manager
----------------------------------------------

With Ubuntu, most of these dependencies can be installed with a `apt-get`:

* **Ubuntu Linux 16.04**:

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install ${dependencies_ubuntu_16_deb}

  Note that Ubuntu 16.04 does not have up-to-date packages for all dependencies. LibInt2
  must be compiled manually as explained in :ref:`windows_manual_dependency_install`.

* **Ubuntu Linux 15.04 and 14.04**:

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install ${dependencies_ubuntu_15_deb}
    pip install --user --upgrade ${dependencies_ubuntu_15_pip}

  Note that Ubuntu 15.04 and 14.04 do not have up-to-date packages for all dependencies.
  Hence, some are installed with PIP. LibInt2 must be compiled manually as explained in
  :ref:`windows_manual_dependency_install`.


.. _windows_manual_dependency_install:

Installing dependencies manually
--------------------------------

If the package manager of your Linux distribution does not have the desired
packages (or the right versions), you have to install them manually, e.g.
download and execute an installer, or download and unpack a binary package. On
HPC environments a compilation from scratch is recommended.

**LibXC**

The directory ``tools/qa`` of the HORTON source tree contains scripts to download and
build LibXC, which will work on most systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    ${custom_install_libxc}

This results in a LibXC library suitable for compiling HORTON. If this fails,
consult your local Linux guru to build LibXC. For more info about LibXC, check
the website: http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc

**LibInt2**

The directory ``tools/qa`` of the HORTON source tree contains scripts to download and
build LibInt2, which will work on most systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    ${custom_install_libint}

The compilation of LibInt2 takes a few minutes and results in a library suitable for
compiling HORTON. If this fails, consult your local Linux guru to build LibInt2. For more
info about LibInt2, check the website: https://github.com/evaleev/libint

**Python dependencies**

In some cases, PIP, the Python package manager, may be a good choice to install
the most recent versions of the Python packages in the list of dependencies. Examples
are given above for Ubuntu and Fedora.


.. _windows_compile_install:

Compilation and installation
============================

Build and install
-----------------

The regular build and install is done as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./setup.py install --user

The ``setup.py`` script makes a reasonable attempt at configuring the compiler and
linker settings for the LibXC, LibInt2 and BLAS libraries. However, this does
not work in all environments. In case of a failure, or if a configuration other
than the default is desired, read the following section.


Overriding default compiler/linker settings for LibXC, LibInt2 and BLAS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The manual configuration of the compiler and linker settings is described here:
:ref:`setup_cfg`. You should read this section if the default build and install
has failed or if you would like to specify which libraries to use.


Runtime configuration
---------------------

You need to set the following variable in ``~/.bashrc`` to use HORTON:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}

    # If you used special link options for LibXC, LibInt2 or BLAS, something along
    # the following lines may also be needed:
    # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=some_dir/with/shared_objects/${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

If you run HORTON on a headless node, i.e. without an X server, you need to
configure Matplotlib to use a backend that does not require a graphical user
interface. (See http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend for
more details on the Matplotlib backends.) This can be done by adding the
following line to your ``matplotlibrc`` file:

.. code-block:: text

    backend: agg

This file is located in either ``${HOME}/.matplotlib`` or
``${HOME}/.config/matplotlib``.




Reference atoms
===============

Several parts of HORTON make use of reference atomic computations. When compiling
a stable release from a .tar.gz file these reference atoms are already included in
the release. When building a development version of HORTON, please refer to
:ref:`ref_build_refatoms` on how to build these reference atoms.


Running the tests
=================

To test if HORTON was installed properly and if it can be accessed from any directory,
you should change to a directory outside of the source tree and call nosetests
as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd ~; nosetests -v horton)


Building the documentation
==========================

Dependencies
------------

If you are interested in generating the documentation from source, the following
packages are also needed:

${doc_dependencies_rst}


Installing the dependencies with a package manager and PIP
----------------------------------------------------------

* **Ubuntu Linux 16.04**:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install ${doc_dependencies_ubuntu_16_deb}

* **Ubuntu Linux 15.04 and 14.04**:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install ${doc_dependencies_ubuntu_15_deb}
      pip install --user --upgrade ${doc_dependencies_ubuntu_15_pip}

You must also manually build LibXC as explained in :ref:`windows_manual_dependency_install`,
to generate the list of DFT functionals in the documentation.


Actual build
------------

The documentation is compiled and viewed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd doc; make html; firefox _build/html/index.html)


.. _windows_install_dev:

Development tools
=================

If you want to contribute to the development of HORTON, you'll need to install at least
the following dependencies:

${dev_dependencies_rst}

For the python development tools, we generally recommend installing the latest versions
with ``pip``.

* **Ubuntu Linux 16.04**:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install ${dev_dependencies_ubuntu_16_deb}
      pip install --user --upgrade ${dev_dependencies_ubuntu_16_pip}

* **Ubuntu Linux 15.04 and 14.04**:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install ${dev_dependencies_ubuntu_15_deb}
      pip install --user --upgrade ${dev_dependencies_ubuntu_15_pip}
