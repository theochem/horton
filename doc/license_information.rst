License Information
###################

Horton is distributed under the conditions of the GPL License version 3. Amongst
other things, this has the following practical implications:

- You are free to use Horton for any purpose but the (re)distribution of Horton
  or any derived program must be done under the same license conditions.

- Once you share a modified version of HORTON with someone, there is no legal
  way to stop your modified version from being distributed further. If you want
  to keep a new feature under the radar until it is published in a scientic
  journal, then only share it with people you absolutely trust.

- Whenever copyrights are attributed to the *HORTON Development Team*, this
  means that each author remains copyright owner of his contributions. By
  sharing their contribution, they agree to do so under the conditions of the
  GPL License version 3. Contribtions are always defined as the changes made in
  each commit in a revision control system (currently Git).
