Download and installation with a package manager
################################################

The installation of HORTON is supported by some package managers, which may be a lot
easier than the from-source installation discussed in the following sections. Below we try
to keep track of them.

Installing HORTON with any of these methods requires less technical skills but it may have
disadvantages too: (i) less control over the compilation process and (ii) older versions
of HORTON and its dependencies.

After installation with one of the package managers, you should be able to run the tests
as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    nosetests -v horton

Conda
=====

Conda is a package manager for scientific applications in Python. It supports multiple operating systems. HORTON has been packaged
in the conda-forge repository. You can install the miniforge version of conda from https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge. 

You may install HORTON as follows:

.. code-block:: bash
    # We recommend using mamba to install faster
    conda install mamba

    # Please install HORTON into a clean environment
    conda create -n horton2
    conda activate horton2

    # Install HORTON
    mamba install horton 

_If you have installed a different distribution of conda (e.g. miniconda, anaconda), please make sure to add conda-forge as a 
source repository or use `-c conda-forge` when installing packages._


MacPorts
========

MacPorts is a package manager specific for OSX. After you have installed MacPorts, see
https://www.macports.org/install.php, you can install HORTON as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port install gcc49; sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc49
    sudo port install python27 +readline; sudo port select --set python python27
    sudo port install horton
    sudo port install py27-pip; sudo port select --set pip pip27

This will also install all the dependencies required for HORTON.

At the time of writing, there is still a small glitch in the MacPorts installation of the
LibXC dependency, which may cause some tests to fail.

There seems to be no official way to use MacPorts without ``sudo``, while this may
potentially break your system. You've been warned.


Easybuild
=========

EasyBuild is a package manager for HPC environments but works on any Linux system. Once
you have EasyBuild installed and configured, see http://hpcugent.github.io/easybuild/, you
can install HORTON e.g. as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   eb horton-2.0.0-intel-2015b-Python-2.7.10-HDF5-1.8.15-patch1-serial.eb --robot

The ``--robot`` option will instruct EasyBuild to install all dependencies as well.

There are several config files one can use for different version of HORTON, in combination
with different compilers and Python dependencies. For the current list of configs, see:
https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/h/horton
You can change the toolchain and the version of HORTON with the ``--try-*`` options
discussed here:
