// UPDATELIBDOCTITLE: Low-level implementation of nuclear potential on a grid


#ifndef GBASIS_NUCPOT_H_
#define GBASIS_NUCPOT_H_

/** @brief
        Compute the electrostatic potential due to the nuclei on a grid.

    @param coordinates
        The pointer to an array with atomic coordinates. This array contains
        3*natom elements of an (atom,3) array in row-major ordering.

    @param charges
        The pointer to an array with atomic core charges. This array contains
        natom elements.

    @param natom
        The number of atoms.

    @param points
        The pointer to the array with coordinates of the grid points. This array
        contains 3*npoint elements of an (npoint,3) array in row-major ordering.

    @param output
        The pointer to the output array. This array constins npoint elements.

    @param npoint
        The number of grid points.
