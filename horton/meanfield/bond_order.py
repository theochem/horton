r"""Generic implementation of bond orders for mean-field wavefunctions

   In the context bond orders and self-electron delocalization indices (SEDI's)
   are always one an the same thing. For two AIM overlap operators, :math:`S_A`
   and :math:`S_B`, the bond order is defined as:

   .. math::
       \text{BO}_{AB} = 2 \mathrm{Tr}\left[
            (D^{\alpha} S^A)(D^{\alpha} S^B) + (D^{\beta} S^A)(D^{\beta} S^B)
       \right]

   where :math:`D^{\alpha}` and :math:`D^{\beta}` are the density matrices of the
   :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` electrons, respectively. A related quantity
   is the valence of an atom. It is defined as:

   .. math::
       V_A = 2 N_A - \mathrm{Tr}\left[ (D S^A)(D S^A) \right]

   where :math:`D` is the sum of the :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` electron
   density matrices, and :math:`N_A` is the population of atom :math:`A`. The
   free valence is defined as:

   .. math::
       F_A = V_A - \sum_{B \neq A} \text{BO}_{AB}
