       **Arguments:**

       orb
            orbitals.

       operators
            A list of one-body operators.

       **Optional arguments:**

       work
            A work array with shape (len(operators), nfn, nfn), where nfn is
            the number of occupied and virtual orbitals.

       **Returns:** a symmetric matrix where each element corresponds to a pair
       of operators. Note that this function is only reliable when no degenerate
       orbitals are present at the fermi level. For example, in case of
       fractional occupations in DFT, this method does not give the correct
       non-interacting response matrix.
