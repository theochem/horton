Download and installation from source on Windows 10 64-bit (v. 1607)
####################################################################


Disclaimer
==========

HORTON has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 subsystem available on Windows 10 64-bit (after
Windows 10 Anniversary Update i.e. v.1607). The Ubuntu 14.04 subsystem is not available to
any Windows operating systems prior to the Windows 10 (v.1607) or 32-bit Windows systems.
Cygwin based installation is not supported (although possible in theory).


Enable Bash on Windows 10
=========================

Provided you are using the appropriate version of Windows 10 (64-bit, after Window 10
Anniversary Update), go to "Settings > Update & Security > For Developers" (or
alternatively search "Use Developer Features") and activate "Developer Mode". Then, go to
"Programs and Features" and click "Turn Windows Features On or Off". Check the box
"Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)". Restart Computer. Search "Bash" to open Ubuntu 14.04
subsystem terminal.


Check Ubuntu Version (Just In Case)
===================================
On bash,

.. code-block:: bash

  lsb_release -a

It should be `14.04.4 LTS`, but other versions may be available.


Dependencies for building, installing and testing HORTON
========================================================

In order to compile and test HORTON, you need to install relatively recent
versions of the following programs/libraries:

* GCC, G++ and GFortran >=4.9: http://gcc.gnu.org (In principle the Intel compilers or any other combination of C++11 and Fortran compiler should work. The GNU compilers are used for development and testing.)
* Python >=2.7,<3.0: http://www.python.org/ (Also install development files.)
* Nosetests >=1.1.2: http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/
* NumPy >=1.9.1: http://www.numpy.org/
* SciPy >=0.11.0: http://www.scipy.org/
* Cython >=0.17.1: http://www.cython.org/
* H5Py >=2.2.1: http://www.h5py.org/
* Sympy >=0.7.1: http://code.google.com/p/sympy/
* Matplotlib >=1.0: http://matplotlib.org/
* LibXC ==2.2.2: http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc (Also install development files.)
* LibInt ==2.0.3: http://sourceforge.net/p/libint/home (Also install development files.)
* Curl >=7.0: http://curl.haxx.se/
* PIP >=7.0: https://pip.pypa.io/ (Not required in some scenarios but never bad to have.)


Installing dependencies with a package manager
----------------------------------------------

With Ubuntu, most of these dependencies can be installed with a `apt-get`:

* **Ubuntu Linux 16.04**:

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ gfortran python-dev python-nose python-scipy cython \
                python-h5py python-sympy python-matplotlib \
                libxc-dev curl python-pip

  Note that Ubuntu 16.04 does not have up-to-date packages for all dependencies. LibInt2
  must be compiled manually as explained in :ref:`windows_manual_dependency_install`.

* **Ubuntu Linux 15.04 and 14.04**:

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ gfortran python-dev python-nose python-scipy cython \
                python-h5py python-sympy python-matplotlib \
                libxc-dev curl python-pip
    pip install --user --upgrade numpy

  Note that Ubuntu 15.04 and 14.04 do not have up-to-date packages for all dependencies.
  Hence, some are installed with PIP. LibInt2 must be compiled manually as explained in
  :ref:`windows_manual_dependency_install`.


.. _windows_manual_dependency_install:


Installing dependencies manually
--------------------------------

If the package manager of your Linux distribution does not have the desired
packages (or the right versions), you have to install them manually, e.g.
download and execute an installer, or download and unpack a binary package. On
HPC environments a compilation from scratch is recommended.

**LibXC**

The directory ``tools/qa`` of the HORTON source tree contains scripts to download and
build LibXC, which will work on most systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/qa/install_libxc-2.2.2.sh

This results in a LibXC library suitable for compiling HORTON. If this fails,
consult your local Ubuntu guru to build LibXC. If you decided to make a custom compilation
of LibXC, keep in mind that it is not reliable when using aggressive compiler optimization
flags. For more info about LibXC, check the website:
http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc

**LibInt2**

The directory ``tools/qa`` of the HORTON source tree contains scripts to download and
build LibInt2, which will work on most systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/qa/install_libint-2.0.3.sh

The compilation of LibInt2 takes a few minutes and results in a library suitable for
compiling HORTON. If this fails, consult your local Linux guru to build LibInt2. For more
info about LibInt2, check the website: https://github.com/evaleev/libint

**Python dependencies**

In some cases, PIP, the Python package manager, may be a good choice to install
the most recent versions of the Python packages in the list of dependencies. Examples
are given above for Ubuntu and Fedora.


Download the code
=================

The latest stable source code release of HORTON can be downloaded here:

    https://github.com/theochem/horton/releases/download/2.1.0b3/horton-2.1.0b3.tar.gz

Choose a suitable directory, e.g. ``~/build``, download and unpack the archive

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/build
    cd ~/build
    curl -kLO https://github.com/theochem/horton/releases/download/2.1.0b3/horton-2.1.0b3.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf horton-2.1.0b3.tar.gz
    cd horton-2.1.0b3


.. _windows_compile_install:

Compilation and installation
============================

Build and install
-----------------

The regular build and install is done as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./setup.py install --user

The ``setup.py`` script makes a reasonable attempt at configuring the compiler and
linker settings for the LibXC and LibInt2 libraries. However, this does not work in all
environments. In case of a failure, or if a configuration other than the default is
desired, read the following section.


Overriding default compiler/linker settings for LibXC and LibInt2
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The manual configuration of the compiler and linker settings is described here:
:ref:`setup_cfg`. You should read this section if the default build and install
has failed or if you would like to specify which libraries to use.


Runtime configuration
---------------------

You need to set the following variable in ``~/.bashrc`` to use HORTON:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}

    # If you used special link options for LibXC or LibInt2, something along
    # the following lines may also be needed:
    # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=some_dir/with/shared_objects/${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

If you run HORTON on a headless node, i.e. without an X server, you need to
configure Matplotlib to use a backend that does not require a graphical user
interface. (See http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend for
more details on the Matplotlib backends.) This can be done by adding the
following line to your ``matplotlibrc`` file:

.. code-block:: text

    backend: agg

This file is located in either ``${HOME}/.matplotlib`` or
``${HOME}/.config/matplotlib``.


Running the tests
=================

To test if HORTON was installed properly and if it can be accessed from any directory,
you should change to a directory outside of the source tree and call nosetests
as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd ~; nosetests -v horton)
